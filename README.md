# Cyber Security Threat Classifier

This project analyzes and classifies cyber security threats using statistical methods and machine learning techniques. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature analysis, and model evaluation to identify patterns and predict threat categories.

---

## Features
- **Chi-Square Analysis**: Measures the association between categorical variables.
- **Cramér's V Calculation**: Quantifies the strength of association between features and the target variable.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and normalizes features.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements classification models to predict threat categories.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
